        </p>
        <p><strong>Version: v4.0.4</strong></p>
    </div>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>
            This mod is an adaptation of the Tower of Deception
            <acronym title="Dungeons And Dragons">D&D</acronym> adventure originally
            created by Monte Cook for the
            <strong><a href="http://www.wizards.com/">D&D website</a></strong>. I liked this adventure, so I thought it
            could be a good idea to
            transform it into BG2:ToB engine. I couldn't keep all aspects of the
            original adventure due to
            <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> engine limits (e.g.
            non-existing creatures etc.), so I made my own little modified version.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Compatibility</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>
            This mod is designed to work with
            <strong>Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal</strong> (with the latest
            patch - <strong>v26498</strong> installed),
            <strong>Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition</strong> and
            <strong>Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition Trilogy</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please install <strong>Tower of Deception</strong> mod after
            <strong>Divine Remix </strong>mod, as it alters spells in Lizard Man Shamans spellbook.
        </p>
        <p>Other than that there are currently no known incompatibilities.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>
            <strong>Windows</strong><br />
            The Tower of Deception mod is packaged and installed with
            <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and is
            distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply
            double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using
            Windows explorer, 7zip or WinRAR tools. If properly extracted, you
            should have a 'tod' folder and setup-tod.exe. Move those into Baldur's Gate II folder.
            To install, double-click 'setup-tod.exe' and follow the instructions on screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please run setup-tod.exe in your Baldur's Gate II folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change
            components.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Linux / macOS</strong><br />
            As of v4.0.1, the mod is expected to work on Linux and macOS, but it
            has not been tested on those platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
            In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod
            using
            'setup-tob --uninstall' at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <p>
            When Ustrain Yg'nuv, an evil githyanki wizard, built his tower on a
            rocky island amid the misty moors of Halron Bay, he had no idea that
            sailors would mistake the light of his magical Astral Shard at the top
            of his tower for the beacon of a lighthouse. The light brought many
            sailors to an untimely doom. But Ustran did not care. He laughed at
            their plight and continued his nefarious work: using the power of the
            Astral Shard to kidnap creatures in the midst of teleporting and divert
            them to his lair. One day, however, his own people appeared to drag the
            githyanki wizard back to his native Astral Plane. He's not been seen
            since.
        </p>
        <p>
            But his tower remains. Not only does it continue to trick sailors on
            foggy nights (though most now have been warned by the legends of the
            "haunted lighthouse"), but the magic of the Astral Shard continues
            Ustrain's evil abduction scheme. Originally, Ustrain enslaved or robbed
            the victims the Shard delivered to him. With the githyanki gone, now
            they remain trapped within the evil tower until they devise an escape or
            die.
        </p>
        <p>
            You and your group are hired by a mage called Tian to go visit the tower
            and find something valuable for him, for a reasonable price, of course.
            Tian is located in The Crooked Crane Inn at the City Gates. Go there,
            speak with him and adventure begins...
        </p>
        <p>
            Recommended average party level is between
            <strong>10 - 13.</strong> Also you should have some stronger weapons
            equipped, <strong>Lilarcor +3</strong> is a good example. I don't
            recommend to play it on lower levels, as there are some monsters that
            can't be hit without weapons of at least +2 enchantment...
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Battle with Ustrain has been changed. Originally it has two versions -
                with or without IA installed. But I have received many reactions from
                players that the battle is either too hard with IA, or too easy
                without it. Also they wanted a version independent from IA, so
                Razfallow remade Encounter with Ustrain, using his own scripts. This
                version is more like an addition to the previous one than a
                replacement. For those who want to play without IA installed, but with
                harder Ustrain.
